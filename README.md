Cheatsheet for the MITx course 18.6501x Fundamentals of Statistics
by Blechturm.
 
 Please note that since I am working alone on this there has been no cross-check of the formulae and definitions. I am trying to do my best to be diligent but errors are possible. So please use it at your own risk. It is also a reflection of my mind and the things I find important which may not coincide with your priorities. If you want to help me drop be a line.
