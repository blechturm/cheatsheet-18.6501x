\subsection{Useful to know}

\subsubsection{Min of iid exponential r.v}
Let  $X_1,…,X_nn$  be i.i.d. $Exp(\lambda)$ random variables.

Distribution of $min_i(Xi)$ 

\begin{align*}
   \mathbf{P}(\min _ i (X_ i)\leq t) &=\\
&=1-\mathbf{P}(\min _ i (X_ i)\geq t)\\
&=1-(\mathbf{P}(X_1\geq t))(\mathbf{P}(X_2\geq t))\ldots (\mathbf{P}(X_ n\geq t))\\
&=1-(1-F_ X(t))^ n \, =\, 1-e^{-n\lambda x}
\end{align*}

Differentiate w.r.t $x$ to get the pdf of $min_i(Xi)$:

\begin{align*}
f_{\text {min}}(x)= (n\lambda ) e^{-(n\lambda ) x}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Counting Commitees}

Out of  $2n$  people, we want to choose a committee of $n$ people, one of whom will be its chair. In how many different ways can this be done?" 

$$n\binom {2n}{n}=2n\binom {2n-1}{n-1}.$$

“In a group of  2n  people, consisting of  n  boys and  n  girls, we want to select a committee of  n  people. In how many ways can this be done?"

$$\binom {2n}{n}=\sum _{i=0}^ n \binom {n}{i}\binom {n}{n-i}$$

“How many subsets does a set with  2n  elements have?" 

$$2^{2n}=\sum _{i=0}^{2n}\binom {2n}{i}$$

“Out of  $n$  people, we want to form a committee consisting of a chair and other members. We allow the committee size to be any integer in the range  $1,2,…,n$ . How many choices do we have in selecting a committee-chair combination?"

$$n2^{n-1}=\sum _{i=0}^ n \binom {n}{i}i.$$

\subsection{Finding Joint PDFS}

$f_{X,Y}(x,y)=f_ X(x)f_{Y|X}(y\mid x)$
